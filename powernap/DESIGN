powernapd States
 * asleep
   * powernapd has successfully taken its action, and has not been awoken yet
   * system could be in:
     * custom      (cpu is online, monitors can run)
     * powersaving (cpu is online, monitors can run)
     * suspended   (cpu is offline)
     * hibernated  (cpu is offline)
     * powered off (cpu is offline)
 * awake
     * cpu is online monitors can run

Monitors
 * Network
   * WOLMonitor 
     * event:	 bind to ports 7 and 9 and watch for magic packet
     * response: record timestamp on any WoL packet arrives
		 wake immediately if asleep
     * default:	 watch udp:7 or udp:9
   * UDPMonitor 
     * event:	 bind to specified ports and watch for activity
     * response: record timestamp on any packet arrives on any of a list of specified udp ports
		 wake immediately if asleep
     * default:  no monitored ports
   * TCPMonitor
     * poll:     run every INTERVAL seconds, looking for connections on specified ports
     * response: record timestamp on any established connection against a list of specified tcp ports
		 wake immediately if asleep
     * default:  no monitored ports (document that monitoring 22|80|443 might be useful)
 * User Input
   * USBMonitor
     * response: record timestamp on any activity on USB input
		 wake immediately if asleep
     * default:  keyboard and mouse
   * PS2Monitor
     * response: record timestamp on any activity on PS2 input
		 wake immediately if asleep
     * default:  keyboard and mouse
 * System
   * Process
     * poll:     run every INTERVAL seconds, looking for matching processes
     * response: record timestamp on any process matching a list of regexes is running
		 wake immediately if asleep
     * default:  no monitored processes
   * ProcessIO
     * response: record timestamp on any process matching a list of regexes having active io
		 wake immediately if asleep
     * default: no monitored processes
   * Load
     * poll:     run every INTERVAL seconds, looking at /proc/loadavg
     * response: record timestamp if system load is too high
		 wake immediately if asleep
     * default:  system_load / num_cpus > .75


Approach 1:
 * Run all monitors all the time
 * Check all monitor timestamps every INTERVAL seconds
 * Take powernap action (powersave by default) if no timestamp in last ABSENT_SECONDS
 * Continue running monitors in powernap mode
 * Wake from powernap any time any timestamp from any running monitor shows up
 * This is potentially very expensive

Approach 2:
 * Run awake-monitors while awake, asleep-monitors while asleep

Approach 3:
 * Run all monitors at all times.
 * During ABSENT_SECONDS, check activity every INTERVAL seconds
 * During powersave, do NOT check every INTERVAL seconds, but use an EVENT based approach.
 * Example:
   - While in ABSENT_SECONDS TCPMonitor will be checked for activity every INTERVAL_SECONDS (10)
     - If activity was found within the last INTERVAL_SECONDS, then reset absent seconds of monitor.
   - While in POWERSAVE mode, the powernapd will stop polling, and TCPMonitor will send an EVENT
     - This EVENT will instruct machine to take RECOVER ACTION.
